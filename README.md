# Categorical Bayes SparkML classification method

## Description
Categorical variant of naive bayes classification method.
There are Bernoulli and Multinominal variants of Naive Bayess classification method available in SparkML.
Those methods are inspired by text classification applications, they deal with arbitrary length sequences of elements from some finite alphabet A.
Categorical Bayes classification method is applicable to objects described by finite number of discrete attributes, each taking values from different sets.
